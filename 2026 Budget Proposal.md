### Notes

Monthly Water Bill was estimated at $222/month from 2024 bill. To account for Pool water usage the $250 was used and multiplied by 15 months to get a 12 month estimate. Due to the pool water usage will vary considerably from monthly average.

## Pool Operating

| Expenses      | Annual Budgeted |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Pool Supplies | $5,000.00       |
| Pool Staff    | $47,070.00      |

| **Total**     | **$56,570.00**  |

### Notes

Staffing Costs estimated for pool being open [ 8 hours/day ] x [ 6 days/week ] = [ 48 hours / week ]

3 staff members would cost [ ~$23/ employee] x [ 3 employee / hour ] = [ $70 / hour ]

The weekly cost of operation would be [ $70/hour ] x [ 48 hours/week] = [ $3,360/week ]

The pool is projected to be open [ 14 weeks/year ] x [ $3,360/week ] = [ $47,070.00/year ]

### Notes

$100 a month is proposed for Quickbooks or Freshbooks for Treasurer and two other
board members plus Bookkeeper / Accountant.

The zoom account for meetings should be established for the board so that access can be transferred to new future board members and used for committees.

HOA Software was estimated using pricing from PayHOA which allows community voting and input.

PO Box with the US Post oﬃce allows for a consistent address for bills that can be passed to future boards.

Audit -Tax preparation - This expense envisions a “Rolling Audit” of our accounting. Meaning that we would hire our 2025 Auditors early in January and they would do preliminary work every 3 months to audit each quarter and report back to the board. At the end of 2025 they would do the final quarter and file taxes for the HOA.
